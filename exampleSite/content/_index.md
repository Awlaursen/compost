Compost is a simple theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is based on the original [hugo-starter-tailwind-basic](https://github.com/bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic) and [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo).

## Usage (As a theme)

Import `github.com/canstand/compost` into your project, and then run:

```bash
hugo mod npm pack
npm install
```

Then run your project as usual.

```bash
hugo server
```
